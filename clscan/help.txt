Usage:
clscan.exe [/SetScanner "SCANNER_NAME" /SetFileName "FILE_NAME"]
List of actions:
 /SetScanner        Sets the scanner. Exact name must be provided.
                    Use GetScanners to obtain a list of valid scanners name.

 /GetScanners       Shows the list of available scanners. When used, it ignores 
                    all other parameters.
 
 /SetFileName       Sets the output filename. Output name could use system 
                    variables for filename creation. Variable names are case sensitive and must be in
                    upper case.
                    e.g. "&HOMEPATH&\test&COUNTER&.jpg"
                    Allowed variables:
                      &HOMEPATH&
                      &USERNAME&
                      &USERDOMAIN&
                      &USERPROFILE&
                      &COUNTER& - in case of more files with same name
                      (test&COUNTER&.jpg) name will be test01.jpg,test02.jpg...
                      &DD& - Day
                      &MM& - Month

                      &MIN& - Minute
                      &SEC& - Second
                      &MSEC& - Milisecond
                    Type of output file is determined by the file extension.
                    Possible extensions are "bmp", "tif", "tiff", "jpg","jpeg",
                    "png", "pdf". Available extensions are license dependent. 

 /ReadFromIni       If .ini filename is not defined it will try to use 
                    clscan.ini in same directory where it is clscan.exe.
                    If this action is used, other actions / parameters
                    are ignored.
 
 /ReadyFile         Writes to ReadyFile when scanning has finished.
                    For example: /ReadyFile:"c:\test\scan_finished.txt" 
                    will write to "c:\test\scan_finished.txt" number of 
                    processed and scanned pages. If file doesn't exist 
                    it will create it.

 /GetResolutions    Get all available resolutions for the choosen scanner.
                    If /SetScanner is omitted, it will show resolutions 
                    of default scanner.
 
 /SetResolution     Recommended value is 300 DPI or less. 
                    It could be decimal value.
  
 /SetPageSize       Sets the page size. Use GetPageSizes to obtain a list of 
                    valid page size for the chosen scanner. 
                    If /SetScanner is omitted, it will show resolutions
                    of default scanner.
 
 /GetPageSizes      Shows the list of available page sizes for 
                    the chosen scanner. If /SetScanner is omitted, it will 
                    show resolutions of default scanner.
  
 /LogToFile         Name of the file where to write log. Optional.
                    Output name could use system variables for filename 
                    creation. Same variables as for SetFileName are 
                    supported except &COUNTER& which doesn't exist for
                    /LogToFile
 
 /SetJpegQuality    Sets JpegQuality (in percentage) in case 
                    of Jpeg Compression. (Jpeg files and non 
                    Black & White Pdf files) If omitted it will use 
                    default value (85).

 /SetRotation       Rotate the scanning. Possibile values are 0,1,2,3, 4.
                    0 - Portrait (0 degree rotation)
                    1 - 90 degree rotation
                    2 - 180 degree rotation
                    3 - Landscape (270 degree rotation)
                    If ommitted, value of SetRotation is 0.
                    Many scanners doesn't support setting rotation.

 /SetSource         Example of possibile values: Auto, ADF or Flatbed

 /SetDeskew         If scanner has that capability, it tries to deskew 
                    selected image.

 /SetCrop           If scanner has that capability, it tries to 
                    automatically detect paper size in the scanner.
 
 /GetSources        Get list of supported sources  

 /SetTransferType   Possibile values: Memory, File or Native

 /SetDuplex         Sets duplex for the chosen scanner.
                    Value Y will use duplex. Value N will not use duplex.
                    If omitted, scanner default will be used.
 
 /SetColorType      Sets color type.

 /GetColorTypes     Shows the list of available color types for the 
                    chosen scanner. If /SetScanner is omitted, it will 
                    show resolutions of default scanner.
 
 /SetThreshold      Sets treshold. Effective only for BW color type.
 
 /GetThreshold      Gets threshold for the chosen scanner.
                    If supported, in most cases is between 0 and
                    and 255 with default 128. Effective only with 
                    BW color type.

 /SetContrast       Sets contrast for the chosen scanner.
 
 /GetContrast       Gets contrast for the chosen scanner.
                    If supported, in most cases is between -1000
                    and 1000 with default 0.
 
 /SetBrightness     Sets brightness for the chosen scanner.

 /GetBrightness     Gets brightness for the chosen scanner.
                    If supported, in most cases is between -1000
                    and 1000 with default 0.
  
 /SetNumberOfImages Sets the number of images for the chosen scanner 
                    to be scanned from ADF scanner.
                    This parameter is used when scanning from 
                    an ADF scanner which has more pages inserted for 
                    scanning then you need. You can also scan single 
                    images from an ADF scanner using this parameter.
                    If -1 it will scan all pages in the scanner.
                    If omitted it will print images as defined in 
                    scanner default.
 
 /SetMultiFile      Defines that in ADF scanning every image will be 
                    scanned to its own file. If output filename doesn't 
                    have any variable in the name, COUNTER variable will be 
                    automatically added. If omitted and output file isn't 
                    PDF / TIFF file existing file with the same name will 
                    be ovveriden. To avoid that, use COUNTER variable.
                    If scanning isn't ADF, this flag is ignored.

 /SetInvert         Inverts the image.

 /SetConfig         Opens config screen.

 /ShowUI            Shows scanner UI dialog.

 /UseScan2          Uses alternative scan engine.

 /License           Shows license dialog.

 /Help              Shows this help.

 /IgnoreBlankPages  Ignores blank pages.

 /BlankPageThreshold Percentage of darkness which is allowed to 
                     consider something as non blank page.
                    Default is 1%. Allowed values are decimal values
                    between 0 and 100 with decimal point.
                    (for example 2.5 will consider everything bellow 
                    2.5% of darkness as blank page)
                    This switch has effect only in combination 
                    with /IgnoreBlankPages switch.

Important note:
CLScan in some cases, when launched from some web applications (e.g. PHP), doesn't have available 
console which is used to display the visual output from CLScan. 
For example if you execute /getscanners or some similar command. 
If you have the need for a visual output, you can do a console redirection to some file.
It can be done like this:
clscan /getscanners > output.txt
This command will write the output of /getscanners switch to output.txt file.
					
Examples:
clscan.exe /Help
It shows this help.

clscan.exe /ReadFromIni "c:\clscan.ini"
It will use settings defined in "c:\clscan.ini" file.

clscan.exe /ReadFromIni
It will use settings defined in clscan.ini file.
If file isn't find in same directory as clscan.exe it will give error.

clscan.exe /GetScanners
It will list all available scanners.

clscan.exe /GetResolutions /GetPageSizes /GetColorTypes /SetScanner "EPSON Perfection V19"
It will list all available resolutions, page sizes and color types 
for "LX100_Scanner". If /SetScanner is omitted, it will show available 
resolutions, page sizes and color for default scanner.

clscan.exe /LogToFile "C:\scan_log\log.txt" 
           /SetFileName "C:\scan_result\testImage.tiff"
It will do the scanning from the default scanner and it will create 
tiff file in "c:\scan_result\testImage.tiff".
It will write all relevant information in log file "c:\scan_log\log.txt"

clscan.exe /LogToFile "C:\scan_log\log.txt"
           /SetFileName "&HOMEPATH&\testImage&COUNTER&.tiff"
if &HOMEPATH& is "c:\test_scanning\" and if scanning creates 
two files, result will be files:
c:\test_scanning\testImage01.tiff
c:\test_scanning\testImage02.tiff

It will write all relevant information in log file "c:\scan_log\log.txt"

clscan.exe /LogToFile "C:\scan_log\log.txt" 
           /SetFileName "C:\scan_result\testImage.tiff" /SetContrast "45" 
           /SetBrightness "50" /SetTreshold "40" /SetJpegQuality "90"
           /SetSource ADF /SetScanner "LX100_Scanner" /SetNumberOfImages 3
           /SetDuplex:Y /SetColorType "RGB" /SetPageSize "USLETTER"

It will do the scanning from scanner "LX100_Scanner" and it will create one 
tiff file in "c:\scan_result\testImage.tiff" with 3 images scanned 
from the scanner using definied values for contrast, brightness, threshold,
jpegquality and color type.
It will write all relevant information in log file "c:\scan_log\log.txt"

clscan.exe /LogToFile "C:\scan_log\log.txt" 
           /SetFileName "C:\scan_result\testImage.tiff" /SetContrast "45" 
           /SetBrightness "50" /SetTreshold "40" /SetJpegQuality "90"
           /SetSource ADF /SetScanner "LX100_Scanner" /SetNumberOfImages 3
           /SetMultiFile /SetDuplex:Y /SetColorType "RGB" /SetPageSize "USLETTER"

Different from the previous example is that here is used /SetMultiFile which
means it will create 3 different output files with names testImage01.tiff,
testImage02.tiff and testImage03.tiff.
